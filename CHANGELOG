[September 11, 2017][2.1.0]
- Introducing Tier A / Tier B Filter. TA = Most valuable rare and TB = second most valuable rare.
- Removed the sound from all the chancing filter. They are easy to see, there is no need for a sound notification.
- Tweaked the chancing color to be more unique and a lot more visible due to the fact they don't make a sound anymore.
